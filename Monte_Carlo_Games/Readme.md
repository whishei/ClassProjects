# MC Final Project: Computational Game Theory - Othello

Download the following files:
  MCTS.py
  TicTacToe.py
  Othello.py

  Optional: Playing.ipynb 

Make sure all three files are saved in the same directory. 

To play, run either TicTacToe.py or Othello.py 

Optional: play either game from Playing.ipynb

Recommended Settings: 
 - Othello 4x4, Iterations = 2000    (Very Fast)
 - Othello 6x6, Iterations = 500     (About 7 seconds for computer's move still competitive)
 - Othello 8x8, Iterations = 100     (About 10 seconds for computer's move, not very competitive)
